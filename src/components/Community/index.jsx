Each action taken on the platform contributes to our growth. We harness the power of decentralised networks to coordinate users, allowing them to create content free from external influences. We curate content without relying on algorithms, ensuring authenticity and quality. Moderation is conducted by the community and reinforced through our platform's design. We aim to be the first media distribution network to provide uniform content access to all users, regardless of their location.`}</ReactMarkdown>
