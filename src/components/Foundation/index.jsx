                    <p className="text-[19px] md:text-left text-center my-10">The foundationsâ€™ mission is to transform and transcend traditional approaches to audiovisual production, curation and exhibition, fostering an ecosystem  where content creators themselves get  more than 99% of the revenue from their content. </p>
                    <p className="text-[19px] md:text-left text-center my-10">With Kinera, the Kine Foundation is committed to promoting  active audience engagement by embracing a new paradigm. </p>
                    <p className="text-[19px] md:text-left text-center my-10">The Kinera platform is  a community-governed ecosystem. In its final development stage, governance and decision-making will be facilitated through futarchy and other processes that can integrate reputation, token value, and curation markets. This ensures the platform stays aligned with its mission, and its users have a voice in its continuous development.</p>
